# CNN--Intel-Image-Classification
Notebook for HW1- Knowledge Discovery 

## Description

A deep model that consists of 4 Convolutional Layers, to extract and recognize increasingly complex features, followed by 2 Fully Connected Layers and a Classifier to perform multiclass classification (see Fig. 1). Initially, input data flows trough the convolutional layers that, generally increases the channels and reduce the image size, to exploit image information. Then the extracted features are provided to the fully connected layers and to the classifier that, combine the features extracted before and predicts the class outcome among one of the 6 possible classes.

## Dataset
Since the dimensions of the file zip of the dataset exceeds the 100 MB we cannot upload the data on the reposity.
Anyway, we provide the link in which it is possible to download the data the we have used in our model.

DOWNLOAD the data at the following link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/131ftYKcK3_XzbVQhBbMwIqKpg5vvoDXB/view?usp=sharing

These data are taken from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification?ref=hackernoon.com

On Drive you have the data already split in train and test set. The kaggle website provides ad additional folder for the prediction with images without labels.
